# Advent of Code (Scala)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gbusch/AdventOfCode_Scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gbusch/AdventOfCode_Scala)

Advent of Code offers many great puzzles to improve your programming skills!

My daily-life programming language is python (see https://github.com/gbusch/AdventOfCode) but I also try to learn a bit of Scala. This repo contains some of my first attempts. 

Feedback is very welcome.
